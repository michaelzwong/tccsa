    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p>The TCCSA is a network for U of T Trinity College
        students of Chinese background and those who wish to
        learn more about Chinese culture.

       </p>
    <h3>Our Background</h3>
      <p>Rising prestige and international recognition of University of Toronto attracts a great influx of eager
        Chinese international students. As a result, the University of Toronto student body with Chinese heritage
        has become greater and greater. Yet despite the growing presence of Chinese students on campus, the
        expected increase in international communication and exchange seems to lag. More Chinese
        international students choose to stay and confine themselves within the comfort of homogenous
        campus groups and miss out on all other parts of University of Toronto, for example - Hart House,
        college life and campus resources such as CIE, Career Centre. To challenge the status quo and improve
        communication between all student bodies, TCCSA is born - We hope to build a bridge that not only
        improves accessibility of university and college events to Chinese students, but we also provide
        domestic students with gain in international perspective from experiencing the culture of China, a new
        giant in the international playground.
      </p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Trinity College Chinese Students Association was founded with the goal to involve not only students of
        Chinese Heritage, but all members of the Trinity College and University of Toronto Community. The
        ultimate mission is to build a channel for communication between the Chinese students
        and domestic students. To achieve such mission, we aim to achieve the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, we will build a support network for incoming students with Chinese heritage from Canada and
        abroad through events and peer mentorship. To achieve this, we have created a Chinese language social
        network based on “Wechat” (and also its facebook counterpart) that introduces and notifies students of
        social events and student government activities starting from their acceptance to Trinity College and
        University of Toronto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, we will encourage Chinese students to participate and engage in Trinity college and University
        of Toronto events and student governance. In the past, participation of Chinese international students in
        college affairs has been meager.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we will and provide an opportunity for all students to learn and celebrate the Chinese culture.
        This goal will be achieved through our events. In the past we have successfully held two Lunar New Year
        High Tables in Trinity College (Guests are permitted), with attendances exceeding 200. Each academic
        year, we hold six to seven events on campus.
      </p>
